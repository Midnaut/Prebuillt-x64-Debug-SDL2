# Prebuillt-x64-Debug-SDL2

The goal of this is to be a single place I can quickly pull from while working on experiments. 
If you have had issues with SDL2 building in debug mode leading to symbols not loaded issues and it wasnt just a simple error in your code, This might help!

The trick was pull down all the source repos and manually build them all in debug with symbols included. So to save you the work, here they all are.

# How to use

Simply download the repo as a zip, and copy/paste it wherever you store your Dev/libs and you should be good to start linking.
